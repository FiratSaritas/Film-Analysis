# Film-Analysis

## Network analysis with movie data

For this project, we used the public film database of ProCinema, Swiss Association for Cinema and Film Distribution. The film database includes all films that have been shown in Swiss cinemas since 1995. Currently, the database has information on more than 12,000 titles.

The study of the ProCinema database is interesting for several reasons. First, most people know films and actors and can more easily understand the relationships. Therefore, the complex relationships between actors arouse the curiosity of most viewers. Also, the dataset contains extensive information about each movie and actor, which provides a solid basis for a variety of data analyses. The dataset is sufficiently clean and structured to allow analysis without using semantic matching techniques. Our goal is to analyze all movies as well as the main co-actor relationships. We would like to give us an overview of the film and actor space, which is actually known by almost everyone.
